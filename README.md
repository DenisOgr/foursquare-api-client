# JcrollFoursquareApiClient

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jcroll/foursquare-api-client.png)](https://travis-ci.org/jcroll/foursquare-api-client)

## Why?

There is no library currently built to interact with the [foursquare api](https://developer.foursquare.com/) using the fantastic
[Guzzle HTTP Client library](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle). Guzzle is awesome and supplies a lot of great things
for building web service clients.
